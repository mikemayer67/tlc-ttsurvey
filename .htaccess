# Disallow requests for directory listings
Options All -Indexes

# One of the key factors in the configuration of this .htaccess file is to prevent
#   malicient agents from probing its directory/file structure.  It does this through
#   a couple means:
#
#   - requests for directory listings are denied (see above)
#
#   - Both 404 (missing resource) and 403 (forbidden resource) errors are intercepted
#     and the redirected to the web app's landing page.  This prevents the agent from
#     being able to discern between non-existent resources and resources which exist
#     but are being hidden.   (Note that this will also allow URIs that are structured
#     based on functionality rather than host resources.)
#
#   - To furthern obfuscate things, any URI that doesn't conform to the web app's API
#     will be redirected to a "pseudo-404" page with an HTTP status set to 405 (method
#     not allowed).  This is an error code that provides no information about the
#     file structure, only the failure of the URI to comply with the API.

# The If/Else block that follows is intended to support installation of this web app
#   either at the host's root (/) directory or in some subdirectory named identically
#   with the git respository (i.e. tlc-ttsurvey).  
#
#   - It sets the environment variable BASE_URI to point to the location of the 
#     web app on the host (/ or /.../tlc-ttsurvey/)
#
#   - It sets up the redirects for the 403 and 404 error handling (as described above).

# Case where web app is in the tlc-ttsurvey subfolder of the host
#   There may be a better way to do this... (I'm all ears).
#   I used a SetEnvIf so that I could capture the BASE_URI from the regex
#   I could not figure out how to then trun around and use BASE_URI in the
#     if clause... so essentially had to repeat the same regex
<If "%{REQUEST_URI} =~ /tlc-ttsurvey/">
